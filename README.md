## Introduction 
The Smart Agent concept of connecting LLMs and AI Agents to wallets, Dapps, & smart contracts promises to open the world of Web3 to everyone. Chatting in normal language with your Smart Agent and having it understand the question or task, is similar to how Google's search engine opened the early internet up to the general public.

To make Smart Agents accessible to everyone and increase decentralization we propose a network & fairly launched token for incentivizing all four of the key contributors to their operation. Namely, the community of users, coders contributing to the Morpheus software / agents, capital providers funding development / operations and those suppling computation, storage and bandwidth. It has been well shown by the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum that free & open competition for scarce digital tokens can provide scalable infrastructure for a public blockchain over long periods of time.
