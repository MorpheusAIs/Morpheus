# Techno Capital Machine (TCM)
## Code, Capital, Community, Compute: The Open Source Revolution Starts Here

## Introduction
Today, there is no easy way for developers who create software to get rewarded for their work without going through an antiquated process. They have to form a company, foundation or DAO to handle sales, computation, storage, overhead, and collect payments from users.

This proposal for a Techno Capital Machine is meant to create a platform for developers to create and deploy their software.  It does so in a way so that the TCM first handles all the infrastructure and payments before rewarding the developer based on the popularity of the program.

The Morpheus community is leveraging this framework of the Techno Capital Machine (TCM) and using it to accelerate the development of Decentralized AI. Beyond AI development, the TCM concept is pertinent to all Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications, and Web3 programs. See a link to the detailed tokenomics here: [Whitepaper](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/2.WhitePaper.md).

The term Techno Capital Machine is inspired by renowned philosopher [Beff Jezos](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos) and has been first implemented by the Morpheus community.

## Tl;dr
- Developer launches an open source project using the Techno Capital Machine.
- Using TCM, the developer deploys a native token to power their project.
- Users staking stETH can choose to allocate their yield to projects. 
- In exchange for allocating their stETH that generate yield to help fund a project, users are rewarded with a proportional stream of the project’s native token.
- 50% of the yield allocated to a project is used to purchase that project’s native token. 
- The native tokens are then paired with the other 50% of the yield and deposited to a liquidity pool on an AMM.

## TCM As A Solution
Let’s coalesce to create a frictionless way for developers to launch projects using the Techno Capital Machine, shall we?  

The process for a new project is simple:
1. Deploy Smart Contracts to direct Capital yield toward the new open source project.
2. Leverage the available decentralized Compute, Code, and Community which already are involved in open source and freedom tech. 
3. Connect the project to the Morpheus Virtual Machine to access its users already using Smart Agents today.

## TCM Smart Contracts
1. Users direct yield toward the open source project of their choice by depositing assets such as stETH into a Smart Contract.
2. 50% of the daily yield purchases tokens in the open source project, which are contributed to an AMM trading pair as Protocol Owned Liquidity.
3. 50% of the daily yield remains as stETH and is added to an AMM as the other half of the trading pair as Protocol Owned Liquidity.
4. The open source project emits its native token to the contributors of the yield on a daily basis. 
5. Holders of the native tokens have access to the open source project’s utility.
6. Projects could also have  access to other contributors of the Freedom-Tech stack for developers to broaden their ecosystem reach more rapidly.

Examples of open source projects could include Smart Agents, Decentralized Applications, Smart Contracts, Fine-Tuned Models, and tools for software to leverage in specific tasks.


## Morpheus Is The First Project to Implement the TCM Smart Contracts
All the Morpheus Smart Contracts are open source and thus available for anyone looking to launch an open source project. Benefits of the TCM include:

1. Easy to create a fair launch native token to power an open source project.
2. Permissionless as its jurisdiction agnostic, no company needed.
3. The user maintains custody of their principal in the yield producing asset.
4. The yield contributed daily creates a sustainable demand for the native token.
5. The yield contributed daily grows the liquidity of the AMM over time. 
6. Holders of the native token can add additional functionality to their Smart Agent.
7. Creators of the native token can get liquidity for the token they earn.

## Atomic Governance
In addition to being faster and cheaper than forming a company or foundation, the TCM uses what we call “Atomic Governance” to streamline all the decisions related to the software, infrastructure, capital and frontends. In the Atomic Governance model every person involved is able to freely associate and individually decide their contributions without any votes or friction being introduced.

For example, the Coder can choose whether or not to merge any open source contribution the community of coders suggests for their project. Based on how they value the code contribution and the hours the contributor wants as credit for the work. The Compute providers choose the type of AI models and tokens they want to support and the price at which they are willing to offer them. The Capital Providers select which projects to direct their stETH yield toward based on their desire to use the software being created. And lastly, Community builders can choose the projects they want to build front ends for, integrate or otherwise support the development of based on the rewards they receive from project creators.

This TCM framework is much better aligned with a purely free market approach to building, rather than trying to build consensus and achieve coordination among a large number of people which is very time-consuming and difficult especially at an early stage where the software needs to quickly change and iterate until it gets to a good product market fit and even afterward to adapt to new market conditions.

## The Mismatch of Corporate Structures and Decentralized Tech
There is a fundamental mismatch between the desire to build open source and freedom-tech for the world and the traditional corporate compute structure. Many projects which begin as open source resort to eventually forming a company in order to scale their efforts and reward their contributors. Over time, the structure of these companies forces their founders to gradually release less open-source solutions, selfishly starving the communities that created them.

See the recent example of “OpenAI” which started as an open-source project, but later formed a for-profit company, immediately making their software closed source. The tension of this mismatch split their founders and nearly destroyed the company.  It can be likened to a high-stakes power grab between investors, employees, founders, and board members for control.

It’s worth noting that OpenAIs deception resulted in Microsoft and the US government being quietly installed to control the company and its ecosystem. It’s now as open as a bank vault buried 50 meters deep. 

While less known, a similar struggle nearly ended Ethereum at its inception, when the founders were split between a vision for a for-profit model or a foundation model. In Ethereum’s case, the foundation model won out. They then pioneered the use of a foundation in Switzerland and many other Web3 protocols followed in their footsteps over the past decade.

While it's tempting to point to the Ethereum Foundation as the proven model, the barriers to forming a Swiss foundation or association remain fairly steep. Expect to pay at least $250,000- $500,000 USD to set up the entity properly (with a pre-funded budget). Then offices need to be opened in Zug / Zurich,  forcing executives and board members to operate and hold meetings in Switzerland on a regular basis — for the rest of the life of the project. Singapore, the other major hub for Web3 companies, is similarly expensive. 

For all but the best funded entrepreneurs, this model is financially out of reach. For those that can afford it, the barrier of moving to a different country to found an early stage project is insurmountable for those with families and/or for people arriving from countries with travel restrictions.

Lastly, we have DAOs, which have sprung up to offer an alternative governance structure. There are however clear limits to the type of coordination they can enable. Many DAOs try to run all aspects of a project by vote.  This requires lobbying to induce their users to pay attention to governance aspects, and thus insert a great deal of friction to building an early stage project.  Projects usually die on the vine in committee.

We believe that DAOs are most effectively introduced once a project has achieved a mature product-market fit, similar to how Uniswap did, in order to empower the community's voice and provide a mechanism for vetoing detrimental changes, rather than serving as early-stage software project design committees.

And so here we are at the beginning of 2024 and the vast majority of projects are still forming quick companies due to the ease and affordability ($1,000 USD and one-week formation). Open-source founders start telling themselves that they will be somehow different. They will only pick open-source aligned investors. They will only hire employees that build open source, and that they will only take on shareholders who will never want to close source the tech in order to increase the profit of a well-adopted product. That would never happen to them, they tell themselves. 

This self-cooked fantasy normally doesn’t work. Instead, founders find themselves having stepped into a trap in forming an entity fundamentally opposed to their initial values. Reality usually arrives years too late to do anything about it.

So what to do?
It's time for a new model that addresses these issues. All the pieces are in place now to launch the Techno Capital Machine.

## Extending the Morpheus TCM Using the MOR Token
The MOR tokens can serve as a means of extending the Techno Capital Machine to developers who want to build on the Morpehus platform.
This could be implimented in the following way.

- 1. Reuse the same Smart Contracts, just this time instead of providing stETH, users stake MOR tokens.
- 2. The protocol can provide a "yield" for MOR staking say 8% of the MOR tokens out of the Community builder reward related to Code.
- 3. MOR holders can then direct these MOR staking yield to developers who propose / build a specific a Smart Agent.
- 4. The new project goes through a bootstrapping period which the Smart Agent is being developed.
- 5. When the code for the new project is delivered those who staked their MOR toward that specific Smart Agent end up getting a portion of the native tokens in the project as "Capital Providers" just as it worked in the Morpheus fair launch. 
- 6. This brings the capital provision function into the MOR tokenomics.
Just like the most popular thing to do in Ethereum early on was use ETH to provide resources for projects.
Except here the project can skip right to the staking stage and have the benefit of all on chain records for supporters of projects.
- 7. As before MOR holders get to keep their principal and the yield goes to the open source project they want to support.
- 8. Pre prerequisite for this may be in place by Phase 3 as the Code, Capital, Compute are all live on Moprhues and part of Community Front End Builder rewards.
